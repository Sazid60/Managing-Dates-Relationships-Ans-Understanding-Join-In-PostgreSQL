## 9-1 Handling Date and Date Functions in PostgreSQL

#### `Timezone`

- we can see our timezone

```sql
SHOW timezone
```

#### `Timestamp`

- Timestamp means combination of date,time and time zone.

- timestamp is two type

  1. timestamp with timezone

  2. timestamp without timezone

```sql

  CREATE TABLE timeZ(
  ts TIMESTAMP without time zone,
  tsz TIMESTAMP with time zone
  )

  INSERT INTO timeZ VALUES('2024-01-12 10:45:00', '2024-01-12 10:45:00')

  SELECT * FROM timeZ
```

```sql
SELECT now();
```

![alt text](image.png)

- `SELECT now()` Gives us gives us timestamp with time zone.

- now we want to see just `date`

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_DATE
```

![alt text](image-2.png)

- we can also see just the date using `SELECT now()`

```sql
SELECT now()::date;
```

- this is called casting.
- we can also do the casting with time as well and just see the time

```sql
SELECT now()::time;
```

#### converting timestamp format using `to_char(timestamp,text)`

- This takes timestamp and converts to a required text mentioned

```sql
SELECT to_char(now(), 'yyyy/mm/dd')
```

```sql
SELECT to_char(now(), 'dd/yyyy/mm');
SELECT to_char(now(), 'month');
SELECT to_char(now(), 'dd');
```

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-formatting.html

- we can format any type following the documentation

#### `Interval` with dates

- we want to see the date of last year from todays date

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year'
```

- we see 1 month previous date from todays date

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 month'
```

- we can play more around

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year 2 month'
```

#### `age()` with dates

- suppose we have date now we want to calculate the age using `age()`.

```sql
SELECT age(CURRENT_DATE,'1997-07-02')
```

- If we have date of birth we can easily find the age

```sql
SELECT * , age(CURRENT_DATE,dob) from students;
```

#### `Extract()` function usage

- using this we can extract month, day year etc from a date

```sql
SELECT extract(year from '2025-01-25'::date);
SELECT extract(month from '2025-01-25'::date);
SELECT extract(day from '2025-01-25'::date);
```

- ::date Convert the value on the left (in this case, the string '2025-01-25') into the date data type.

#### Lets discuss about `casting`

- sone using `::`

```sql
SELECT '0' :: BOOLEAN
```

- its similar like type casting like nwe are telling `0` will be boolean type. the casting must be logical.

## 9-2 Grouping and Filtering Data with GROUP BY and HAVING

#### `GROUP BY` Usage

- `aggregate` function is used basically with `group by` clause
- `group by` dose something like we have a lot of data and now we want to do grouping country wise. iF we want to do group by using blood group we can do this.

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
GROUP BY country;
```

![alt text](image-3.png)

- this is showing error because we are telling to show all the rows using `*`
- so the proper way of grouping is

```sql

SELECT country FROM students
GROUP BY country;
```

![alt text](image-5.png)

```sql
SELECT country,age FROM students
GROUP BY country;
```

![alt text](image-4.png)

- This also shows the error, since age must be in group by or we have to use aggregate function.
- this is happening age is not relevant to the country groups , does not understand whose age should be shown,

- if we want to see how many students are in each country we acn see that.

```sql
SELECT country, count(*) FROM students
GROUP BY country;
```

![alt text](image-6.png)

- here `count(*)` is acting differently. rather than counting all the students together its counting each grouped countries students and showing.

- this happening because group by works in split,apply and combine procedure when we use `aggregate ` function with `group by`.

![alt text](<WhatsApp Image 2025-05-19 at 11.30.56_fbaa4d2b.jpg>)

- now lets see country wise students average age with the country wise student count.

```sql
SELECT country, count(*), avg(age) from students
GROUP BY country;
```

![alt text](image-7.png)

#### `HAVING` Usage

- using `having` we can filter data made by `group by`
- lets think of like we have grouped using country and saw the average age based on the students of each country, now we want to set a condition like which group has average age greater than 22 show me. `filter groups using having to show only countries with average age above 22`

```sql
SELECT country, avg(age) FROM  students
GROUP BY country
HAVING avg(age) > 22;
```

- here `where` Condition will not workout since where works row by row.
- Lets solve this `Count Students Born In Each Year`

```sql
SELECT extract(year from dob) as birth_year, count(*)
FROM students
GROUP BY birth_year;
```

## 9-3 Constructing Relationships with Foreign Key Constraints

- `Foreign Key` Is Important to make relationship between different tables.

![alt text](<WhatsApp Image 2025-05-19 at 12.03.06_8d7c16a8.jpg>)

- `primary key` is used to identifying a data uniquely
- `Foreign Key` also uniquely identify a row uniquely but other table from where it came.

![alt text](<WhatsApp Image 2025-05-19 at 12.18.00_b2981c21.jpg>)

- we are defining `user_id INTEGER REFERENCES user(id)`.

- now tels do something like `retrieve all posts for user with id 4`

```sql
SELECT * FROM Post
where user_id = 4;
```

- this is ok but we want to see the `title` of post table and the `username` which is in user table.

- lets create the tables

```sql
CREATE TABLE "user" (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL
)

CREATE TABLE post (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES "user" (id)
)
```
